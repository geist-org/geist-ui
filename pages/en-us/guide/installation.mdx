## Installation

### Setup

Ensure your have the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),
and a package manager: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Also, Geist is based on the component library of framework React, which means you must also understand the basics of how to [create projects](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) with the framework

<h4>
  <Dot type="success">Install</Dot>
</h4>

<Tabs initialValue="yarn" hideDivider hideBorder align="flex-end" mt="-46px">
  <Tabs.Item label="Yarn" value="yarn">
    <Snippet>yarn add @geist-ui/core</Snippet>
  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item label="Npm" value="npm">
    <Snippet>npm i @geist-ui/core</Snippet>
  </Tabs.Item>
</Tabs>
<Spacer h={0.5} />
<h4>
  <Dot type="success">Import</Dot>
</h4>

```jsx
// NAME: /src/app.js
import { GeistProvider, CssBaseline } from '@geist-ui/core'

export default () => (
  <GeistProvider>
    <CssBaseline /> // --> base styles
    <AppComponent /> // --> your application
  </GeistProvider>
)
```

<Spacer h={0} mb="8px" />
<h4>
  <Dot type="success">Usage</Dot>
</h4>

```jsx
import { Button, Page, Text } from '@geist-ui/core'

const Home = () => (
  <Page>
    <Text h1>Home Page</Text>
    <Button>Submit</Button>
  </Page>
)
```

### CRA project

[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is the most common scaffold for creating React projects,
and it can drastically reduce the amount of time users spend configuring the toolchain.
For all CRA projects, users do not have to make any configuration changes and simply import the package.

In addition, here is a complete [project example](https://github.com/geist-org/react-getting-started) using Geist on CRA for reference.

### Next.js project

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React server-side rendering framework. Using Geist on framework Next.js requires custom `_app.jsx` files,
Once the project has been initialized, add the `/pages/_app.jsx` file to the `/pages` folder and add the following content:

```jsx
// NAME:pages/_app.jsx
import { GeistProvider, CssBaseline } from '@geist-ui/react'

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return (
    <GeistProvider>
      <CssBaseline />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </GeistProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

If you need server-side rendering in Next.js project,
please refer to the [Server-side rendering](/zh-cn/guide/server-render) subsection to complete the configuration.

In addition, we have provided a complete [Next.js application](https://github.com/geist-org/geist-ui/blob/master/examples/create-next-app/README.md) example for reference.

<Text h3>
  Font rendering on Windows{' '}
  <Text span type="secondary" font=".75em" style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }}>
    [Optional]
  </Text>
</Text>

Some fonts in Web applications do not render best on the _Windows_ platform, or you may think font rendering is not good enough for some character sets (Chinese, Japanese etc.). In this case, you can introduce additional font packages to optimize the rendering:

> You don't need to modify any CSS files or declare fonts.

#### Install `inter-ui`:

<Snippet>yarn add inter-ui</Snippet>

#### Add `Inter Font` to your project:

<Code block my={0} width="100%">
  <span className="token keyword module">import</span>{' '}
  <span className="token string">inter-ui/inter.css</span>
</Code>

### Bundle size

The size of Geist UI at the completion of full packing is about [111kb](https://bundle.js.org/?q=@geist-ui/react) (gzipped),
This is a good score when comparing the size of modern client applications and will not impact the performance of your application.
As a matter of engineering practice, it is recommended that you always split Geist as a separate chunk within your application to get fixed caching.

For higher first screen load speed, try using [Server Side Rendering](/zh-cn/guide/server-render) or perform volume optimization as described below.

#### Import single component manually

For projects with package size requirements, you can choose to import single component manually.

Manually import single components does not guarantee 100% that only a single component will be packaged,
as some components will depend on each other, for example, if only a single `Snippet` component is used in a project, the bundle package
will also contain the `Toast` component. However, this type of optimization can still reduce the size of your application significantly,
provided you only use a small amount components.

```jsx
import Button from '@geist-ui/core/esm/button'

const MyComponent = () => <Button>Submit</Button>
```

#### Auto Tree Shaking

Geist follows the Auto Tree Shaking naming scheme (from community convention),
This allows you to import in the full amount of components, but automatically exclude the parts that are not really used when packaging.
This feature is usually used in conjunction with the [babel-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-import) tool.
This means that even if we use:

```jsx
import { Text } from '@geist-ui/core'
```

You can also get the same effect as described above for 'import single component'.

A classic use case is to add the following config to the `.babelrc`:

```json
// NAME:.babelrc
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "import",
      {
        "libraryName": "@geist-ui/core",
        "libraryDirectory": "esm"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

There are some differences in the way Tree Shaking is added to different scaffolds, you can refer to the following examples.

- [CRA with TreeShaking](https://github.com/geist-org/geist-ui/blob/master/examples/tree-shaking-create-react-app/README.md)
- [Next.js with TreeShaking](https://github.com/geist-org/geist-ui/blob/master/examples/tree-shaking-nextjs/README.md)
- [Webpack with TreeShaking](https://github.com/geist-org/geist-ui/blob/master/examples/tree-shaking-webpack/README.md)

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
